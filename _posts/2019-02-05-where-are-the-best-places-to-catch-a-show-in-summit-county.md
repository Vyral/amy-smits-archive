<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This month, we’re excited to take a look at some great theatre venues around Summit County. Here are three of our favorites.</em></p>

Each month, we’re introducing you to new and exciting businesses around Summit County.

In February, we’re excited to introduce you to some great theatres in the area. We recently visited the [Performing Arts Center](https://www.silverthorne.org/discover-silverthorne/arts-and-culture/silverthorne-performing-arts-center){: target="_blank"} in Silverthorne, which has three indoor theatres and an outdoor music venue.

This is a great place to visit and they have a number of different plays and concerts coming up. There is also the great [Breckenridge Theatre](https://www.backstagetheatre.org/){: target="_blank"} and the [Speakeasy Movie Theatre.&nbsp;](http://speakeasymovies.com/){: target="_blank"}

In the meantime, if you have any questions about real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help.
