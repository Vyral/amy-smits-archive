Although the question of when the best time to buy is a complex question, I’ve got some information to share with you today that shows why May and June specifically are good times to buy a home in this market.

The ski season is mostly over now, which means we are going to start to see homes come off of the rental market and into the purchasing market. Inventory is finally increasing for home buyers, giving them many more options than they had just a few months ago. Interest rates are continuing to stay fairly low as well, and with fewer rentals it is much easier to see properties.

If you were here in the winter and wanted to see properties, it was probably difficult for you since so many of them were rented out. Those properties are vacant now, though.

Another reason to act timely if you want to secure a good deal is because once a property sells, the next similar property that comes on the market will be listed for $10,000 or $15,000 more. We recently saw a wilderness condo come on the market for $305,000 and sell within a few days. The next similar condo that came on the market was listed at $320,000. With inventory so low, that’s how quickly prices are going up.

If you’re thinking about buying a home, reach out to us. We can make sure you’re alerted to the properties that match the criteria you are looking for as soon as they come on the market. If you can’t make it out here to see them in person, we can even set you up with a pair of VR goggles so you can take a 3-D home tour. We do these for every one of our listings and if you haven’t taken a VR tour yet, it’s something you need to do. Reach out to us and we’ll send you a pair of goggles.
