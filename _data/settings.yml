  about_markdown: |
    Amy and Kevin Smits decided early on in their careers that the real estate process was too involved for one or two people to handle effectively. The Smits Team was a direct result of their pursuit of hiring specialists for each and every step of the real estate transaction. If you would like to learn more about how The Smits Team works with buyers, watch this video

    Teamwork is vital in your purchase. Imagine if you use an agent working alone and they are on vacation, sick or otherwise unable to show you property or worse yet, miss an important deadline! Are you willing to risk losing the property of your dreams because your agent isn't available? I wouldn't either. To find out how The Smits Team works together, watch our team video here
